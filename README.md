🌊 Flood Risk Tool (Singapore)
Hey there! Welcome to the Flood Risk Funhouse—a quirky little tool to see if your place is “flooded” or floating high and dry! Enter a location, get a splashy risk report. Pun intended, it’s all for fun! 💦

What’s This About?
Type in a six-digit postal code (any will do!), and this app spits out a flood risk assessment—complete with gauges, a map, and a cheeky tip (ark-building, anyone?). The catch? The flood risk levels are randomly generated, so don’t start sandbagging your house just yet!

How to Play

Drop a Singapore Postal Code: Any six-digit number works (e.g. 238858, 018980, 529510, 738343, 819642 etc. ).
Click Analyze: Watch the magic unfold.
Enjoy the Results: Check out your risk level, map, and a fun verdict.

No PhD required—just a sense of humor!

Disclaimer
⚠️ Heads Up: The flood risk levels are 100% made up for entertainment purposes, as they are randomly generated. If your place looks “submerged,” it’s just the tool having a splashy good time! 😄
